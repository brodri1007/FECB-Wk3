        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>  
          Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each,
          taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays,
          with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher,
          throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat.
          The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play,
          away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance
          counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the
          fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is
          scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started
          as a batter).
